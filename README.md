project 01- ANOVA Analysis

Introduction to Data Scicence -6002

**ABSTRACT**
Background:
In this study, subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment aimed at investigating the impact of different treatments on psychopathic deviant T scores. These scores, which measure a person's need for control or their rebellion against control, were part of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.

Purpose:
The goal of the experiment was to identify a treatment that reduces subjects' psychopathic deviant T scores. The experiment involved three treatment groups, each subjected to different conditions. The research aimed to determine if there were significant differences in the scores based on the treatments provided.

Methods:
A total of forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to three treatment groups:

Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15-minute "therapeutic" tape.
Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15-minute "emotionally neutral" tape on training hunting dogs.
Four hours of sensory restriction with no taped message.
Analysis involved using ANOVA to compare means across the three treatment groups. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to prepare the dataset for ANOVA, and hypothesis testing was performed with the null hypothesis assuming no difference among the means.

Results:
The analysis revealed that the p-value was less than the significance level, and the F-statistic exceeded the F-critical value. As a result, the null hypothesis was rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, indicating significant differences among the means of the treatment groups.

Conclusion:
Based on the significant evidence, it is concluded that there are differences in psychopathic deviant T scores among the treatment groups. Further analysis identified specific pairs of groups with different means: 1) "Four hours of sensory restriction plus a therapeutic tape" - "Four hours of sensory restriction with no taped message" and 2) "Four hours of sensory restriction plus an emotionally neutral tape on training hunting dogs" - "Four hours of sensory restriction with no taped message." These findings suggest that the type of treatment has a significant impact on psychopathic deviant T scores.
